(name of the village) My in- laws Sukhi Ram and Vimla Devi also stay with us. I have studied till class 8 but could not continue my education due to lack of family support.. But this has not stopped me from learning. Two years back I got trained in a program called Enriche organized by Barefoot College, Tilonia. There I learnt about women’s health. We women feel embarrassed/shy to discuss our bodies.\n        We seldom prioritize our health.\n        We don’t know where to seek information on how to take care of our health.\nThis needs to change. I share the knowledge I have gained with all the girls and women in our village and encourage them to take care of their health/bodies.",
